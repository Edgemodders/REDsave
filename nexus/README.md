# REDsave on Nexus Mods

The source of REDsave's Nexus Mods page lives here, so updates are edits in the repo, not in Nexus's text box. It follows EDGEdeck's and EDGEwave's (their `nexus/` folders).

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `description.bbcode` | The page's description, in Nexus's BBCode. Placeholders in parentheses (STATUS, SCREENSHOT) are filled in before the first release |
| `nexus.json` | The page, the main file's upload settings (`upload`), and after a pull the ids found and the hash of the description last pulled |
| `README.md` | This page: the other fields of the Nexus form, the download file, and how to update |

## The page

There is no page yet (`"page": null`). Before the first release the owner makes it by hand on Nexus with the form below, then:

1. Put its number in `nexus.json` as `"page"`.
2. `npm run nexus:pull -- --ids-only` (needs the owner's Nexus key; see REDnode's `nexus/README.md` for where it is kept on the dev PC).
3. From then on the Release workflow's **Update Nexus Mods** box uploads each release: the zip as the main file (the first one on a new page, then a new version with the old one archived), the version's changelog, and `description.bbcode`.

## The Nexus form

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Mod name | REDsave |
| Version | REDsave's version, from `package.json`; the release sets it |
| Category | Utilities, or Modders Resources and Tutorials as the other EDGE tools (check the list for Cyberpunk 2077 when creating the page) |
| Brief overview | A save game manager for Cyberpunk 2077 in VS Code: search and filter your saves by quest, place, lifepath, V and date, keep sets of saves outside the game and swap them in, and give saves your own titles. A VS Code extension, not a game mod. (255 characters at most; this is 241) |
| Author | Edgemodders |
| Language | English |
| Primary image | `docs/assets/brand/nexus.png` (the social layout with room for the EDGEmodders header the owner adds by hand), or `social.png` |
| Requirements | Off-site: VS Code 1.90 or later (or VSCodium, or EDGEkit) |
| Permissions | MIT: open source, free to modify and redistribute with the license notice |
| Tags | Utility, tools, saves |

Tags cannot be set through Nexus's v3 API (only read): set them by hand on the page.

## The download

One main file: `REDsave-<version>-nexus.zip` (`tools/nexus-zip.mjs`), with:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `redsave-<version>.vsix` | The extension, the same file the Marketplace and Open VSX have |
| `README.txt` | How to install it: Install from VSIX in VS Code, or `code --install-extension` |
| `LICENSE.txt` | REDsave's license |

**Mod Manager Download is off** for this file (`"modManager": false`): it is a VS Code extension, and Vortex would deploy it into the game folder, where it does nothing.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run nexus:status` | The page's version, its files and whether the description matches |
| `npm run nexus:pull` | The live description into `description.bbcode`, the ids into `nexus.json`. Then `git diff nexus/` and merge. With `-- --ids-only`, the ids and the live description's hash, keeping the repo's description |
| `node tools/nexus/nexus.mjs check --version <v>` | What a release would do, and whether it may |
| `node tools/check-bbcode.mjs nexus/description.bbcode` | Checks the BBCode's tags before a push |

`tools/nexus/nexus.mjs` and `api.mjs` are REDnode's, copied as they are: change them in REDnode, then copy them again (REDnode's CLAUDE.md lists the repos that keep a copy).

## BBCode used

Nexus's BBCode has no tables or Markdown, so the page uses only: `[b]`, `[i]`, `[size=2..5]`, `[color=#hex]`, `[center]`, `[quote]`, `[line]`, `[list]` with `[*]`, `[url=...]` and `[img]`. Square brackets that are not tags confuse the checker, so placeholders use parentheses. The banner is linked from this repo's `main` branch on GitHub, so it must stay at its path. The colours are the house palette: yellow `#fcee0a` for headings, cyan `#19f3ff` for highlights.
